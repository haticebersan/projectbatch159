    1)StringBuffer is a class in Java, it gives us String
    2)StringBuffer is "mutable" like StringBuilder
    3)StringBuffer is "thread-safe" and "synchronized" but StringBuilder neither "thread-safe" nor  "synchronized"
    4)StringBuffer was created by in Java-5, StringBuilder was created after StringBuffer
    5)StringBuilder has fewer features than StringBuffer that is why it works faster than StringBuffer

    If you need String, you have 3 options in Java
        i)String Class: It gives you "immutable" Strings
        ii)StringBuilder: It gives you "mutable", "non-thread-safe", "non-synchronized" Strings
        iii)StringBuffer: It gives you "mutable", "thread-safe", "synchronized" Strings
