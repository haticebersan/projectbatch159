        //Note: If you use same data type in a mathematical operation result will in the data type
        //      When you divide an int by another int, the result can be double like in 6/5=1.2
        //      but Java makes the data type of the result in int as well.
        //      To convert double to int Java removes the decimal part so 1.2 will be 1
        //      6 / 2 ==> int         6 / 5 ==> int
        System.out.println(6/5);// 1

        //What if you want to see 1.2 when you divide 6 by 5?
        System.out.println(6/5.0);// 1.2
