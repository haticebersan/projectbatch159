        1)If a variable exists in a class Java uses the variable from the class itself
        2)If a class does not have the requested variable in it Java looks for the variable from the parent classes
        3)If you use "this" inside the constructor, it means you are calling a variable from the same class
        4)If you use "super" inside the constructor, it means you are calling a variable from the first level parent class

        ***What is the difference between "this()" and "super()"?
                    this() is used to call constructors from the class itself
                    super() is used to call constructors from the first level parent class

        ***What is the difference between "this" and "this()"?
        "this()" is used to call constructors from the class itself
            "this" for is calling a variable from the same class

       ***What is the difference between "super" and "super()"?

       "super()" is for calling constructors from the first level parent class
       "super" is for calling variables from the first level parent class
